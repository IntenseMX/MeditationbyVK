## Completed Fixes (2025-01-25)

### Android Audio Playback Fix
- Changed MainActivity to extend `AudioServiceActivity` instead of `FlutterActivity`
- Added AudioService declaration to AndroidManifest.xml with `foregroundServiceType="mediaPlayback"`

## Phase 3 â€“ Section A Completion (2025-10-27)
- Audio session configured via audio_session (music category) and Android audio attributes set.
- Interruption handling: pauses on calls/interruptions, ducks and restores volume, pauses on becoming noisy (headphones unplug).
- Background playback validated: iOS Info.plist `UIBackgroundModes: audio` present; Android foreground service and permissions present.
- Resume position persisted on pause/stop/complete.
- Provider exposes stop() for deterministic writes.

Follow-ups
- Consider optional auto-resume policy after transient interruptions.
