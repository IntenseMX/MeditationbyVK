Lyrics:
[Intro - Gentle Ambient]

[Spoken - Compassionate]
Letting your old self die means letting go of the identity you built around surviving.
The person who had to be strong because no one else was.
The person who had to be perfect because love felt conditional.

[Pause]

Those versions protected you.
They got you through.
And there's real grief in releasing them.
Because they were still you.

[Piano Solo]

Now you're being asked to let them go and trust there's a version of you underneath all that armor.
A version that doesn't need to perform or protect or prove.
A version that can just exist.

[Pause]

So how do you do it?
You start by observing without judgment.
You notice the patterns.
Oh, there's the old program running.

[Pause]

In that awareness, something shifts.
You can't be aware of the loop and stay in the loop at the same time.
Awareness itself breaks the cycle.

[Gentle Guitar Transition]

Then you practice letting yourself be different.
Not performing different.
Actually allowing new thoughts, new choices, new responses.

[Pause]

That discomfort isn't a sign you're doing it wrong.
That's the old self dying and the new self being born.
Birth is messy.
It's painful.
You're in the in between.
The void.
The death before the rebirth.

[Pause]

Most people panic here and run back to the familiar.
But you're not falling apart.
You're falling together in a new way.

[Strings Swell]

When you stop resisting the death of your old self, you become unrecognizable.
Some people won't like it.
They'll say you've changed like it's an insult.
And you'll smile and say, I know.

[Pause]

You're just being.
Fully.
Unapologetically.

[Pause]

That presence, that authenticity, that's what you've been chasing all along.
Not a better version of who you were, but the truest version of who you are.
The one buried under years of conditioning, trauma, expectations, survival.

[Pause]

Your old self was never supposed to last forever.
They were a chapter.
A necessary one.
But chapters end.

[Strings and Piano Together]

The moment you let the old self die with gratitude instead of grief, with trust instead of terror, the next chapter opens.
Not because you earned it, but because you made space for it.

[Pause]

That version emerging right now doesn't need to perform.
Doesn't need to protect.
Doesn't need to prove.
They just need permission to exist.

[Pause]

So let the old you go.
Let them rest.
Let them be the foundation, not the ceiling.

[Long Pause]

Your old self has been dying for a while now.
You just needed to hear it's okay to let them.
This is me telling you it's okay.
Let them go.
And become.

[Outro - Gentle Fade with Hopeful Resolution]
