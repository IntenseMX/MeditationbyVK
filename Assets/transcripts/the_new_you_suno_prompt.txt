Lyrics:
[Intro - Atmospheric Drone]

[Spoken]
There's something you need to understand about why this found you right now.
You're standing at a threshold most people never reach.
When they get here, they turn around and run back to who they used to be.
But you didn't run.

[Pause]

Your old self is dying.
Not metaphorically, not eventually.
Right now.
That restlessness, that sense you don't fit into your own life anymore.
That's not confusion.
That's death.

[Pause - Piano]

You're addicted to who you were.
Not because that version was happy, but because they're familiar.
Your brain has been running the same program for so long it feels like that's just who you are.
But it's not.
It's who you've been practicing.

[Drone Deepens]

Every time you respond to stress the same way, you're being a recording of yourself.
A loop playing over and over.
But it's just how you've been.

[Pause]

You can't become who you're meant to be while running the program of who you used to be.
Every new version of yourself trying to emerge is filtered through the old operating system.
Built on past wounds, past fears, versions of reality that don't exist anymore.

[Pause]

You keep repeating the same patterns.
Dating the same type of person in a different body.
Chasing goals that don't fulfill you.
You're exhausted from dragging a dead version of yourself into every new moment.

[Pause - Atmospheric]

Somewhere deep inside, you know it's time to let them go.
But you're terrified.
Because letting go feels like dying.
And it is.

[Pause - Piano]

But here's what makes this moment different.
You're finally realizing the old you has to die for the new you to be born.

[Pause]

The thoughts that got you here won't get you there.
The beliefs that kept you safe are keeping you small.
The identity you're clinging to is the cage preventing you from becoming free.

[Drone Intensifies]

Until you're willing to let that version die, to grieve them, thank them, and release them, you'll stay stuck.
You're trying to build a new life with the blueprint of an old one.

[Pause]

Something has to die for something to be born.
That's not a metaphor.
That's the law.

[Pause - Strings]

Letting your old self die means letting go of the identity you built around surviving.
The person who had to be strong because no one else was.
The person who had to be perfect because love felt conditional.

[Pause]

Those versions protected you.
They got you through.
And there's real grief in releasing them.
Because they were still you.

[Piano Solo]

Now you're being asked to let them go and trust there's a version of you underneath all that armor.
A version that doesn't need to perform or protect or prove.
A version that can just exist.

[Pause]

So how do you do it?
You start by observing without judgment.
You notice the patterns.
Oh, there's the old program running.

[Pause]

In that awareness, something shifts.
You can't be aware of the loop and stay in the loop at the same time.
Awareness itself breaks the cycle.

[Atmospheric Transition]

Then you practice letting yourself be different.
Not performing different.
Actually allowing new thoughts, new choices, new responses.

[Pause]

That discomfort isn't a sign you're doing it wrong.
That's the old self dying and the new self being born.
Birth is messy.
It's painful.
You're in the in between.
The void.
The death before the rebirth.

[Pause]

Most people panic here and run back to the familiar.
But you're not falling apart.
You're falling together in a new way.

[Drone Swells]

When you stop resisting the death of your old self, you become unrecognizable.
Some people won't like it.
They'll say you've changed like it's an insult.
And you'll smile and say, I know.

[Pause]

You're just being.
Fully.
Unapologetically.

[Pause]

That presence, that authenticity, that's what you've been chasing all along.
Not a better version of who you were, but the truest version of who you are.
The one buried under years of conditioning, trauma, expectations, survival.

[Pause]

Your old self was never supposed to last forever.
They were a chapter.
A necessary one.
But chapters end.

[Strings Enter]

The moment you let the old self die with gratitude instead of grief, with trust instead of terror, the next chapter opens.
Not because you earned it, but because you made space for it.

[Pause]

That version emerging right now doesn't need to perform.
Doesn't need to protect.
Doesn't need to prove.
They just need permission to exist.

[Pause]

So let the old you go.
Let them rest.
Let them be the foundation, not the ceiling.

[Long Pause]

Your old self has been dying for a while now.
You just needed to hear it's okay to let them.
This is me telling you it's okay.
Let them go.
And become.

[Outro - Fade]
