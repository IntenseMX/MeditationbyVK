Lyrics:
[Intro - Gentle Ambient Swell]

[Spoken]
There's something you need to understand about why this found you right now.
You're standing at a threshold most people never reach.
When they get here, they turn around and run back to who they used to be.
But you didn't run.

[Pause]

Your old self is dying.
Not metaphorically, not eventually.
Right now.
That restlessness, that sense you don't fit into your own life anymore.
That's not confusion.
That's death.

[Pause - Piano]

You're addicted to who you were.
Not because that version was happy, but because they're familiar.
Your brain has been running the same program for so long it feels like that's just who you are.
But it's not.
It's who you've been practicing.

[Soft Guitar]

Every time you respond to stress the same way, you're being a recording of yourself.
A loop playing over and over.
But it's just how you've been.

[Pause]

You can't become who you're meant to be while running the program of who you used to be.
Every new version of yourself trying to emerge is filtered through the old operating system.
Built on past wounds, past fears, versions of reality that don't exist anymore.

[Pause]

You keep repeating the same patterns.
Dating the same type of person in a different body.
Chasing goals that don't fulfill you.
You're exhausted from dragging a dead version of yourself into every new moment.

[Pause - Strings Enter]

Somewhere deep inside, you know it's time to let them go.
But you're terrified.
Because letting go feels like dying.
And it is.

[Pause - Piano]

But here's what makes this moment different.
You're finally realizing the old you has to die for the new you to be born.

[Pause]

The thoughts that got you here won't get you there.
The beliefs that kept you safe are keeping you small.
The identity you're clinging to is the cage preventing you from becoming free.

[Pause]

Until you're willing to let that version die, to grieve them, thank them, and release them, you'll stay stuck.
You're trying to build a new life with the blueprint of an old one.

[Pause]

Something has to die for something to be born.
That's not a metaphor.
That's the law.

[Outro - Contemplative Fade]
